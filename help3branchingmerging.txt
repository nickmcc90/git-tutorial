1. Merging
2. Branching
3. Feature Branch Workflow


Imagine that you are working on some code for your job. You make two commits, but they are works-in-progress,
are you plan on going back to look at them/fix them.
Then your boss comes up to you and says that there is a bug in their website and they want you to fix it. What
you wouldn't do is save a commit that fixes the bug right after the two commits that you made because you aren't
sure if those WIPs work yet. 
The solution would be to branch off your WIPs, and have the bug fixing code be in the main branch of code. 

So basically, you can have the bug fix on the main branch of code, while your new feature WIPs can be on a separate branch.

**Let's make a folder called git-brancing for this lesson.
